The 90 km bike course features two laps along the iconic Beach Road, renowned for its flat terrain and scenic coastal views. However, unpredictable coastal winds can turn this segment into a tactical challenge, demanding both power and aerodynamics from competitors.

The final 21.1 km run weaves along the St Kilda and Elwood waterfronts, offering athletes a mix of flat stretches and gentle inclines, all against the backdrop of Melbourne's vibrant bayside community. The race culminates at Catani Gardens, where the energy of spectators fuels the final push to the finish line.
Women's Race: A Clash of Champions

The women's pro field is exceptionally strong this year, featuring a mix of seasoned champions and rising stars, all eager to claim a victory in Melbourne.

Ellie Salthouse returns to reclaim her 2022 title after not competing in 2023. Known for her aggressive racing style and consistent performances, Salthouse is a formidable competitor. In her 2022 win, she swam in 24:38, biked a 2:13:07, and ran in 1:21:28.

"I cherish my victory from 2022," Salthouse remarked. "Missing out last year has only intensified my desire to perform at my best. I've been training hard, focusing on improving my transitions and maintaining a strong pace throughout."

Natalie Van Coevorden, who finished second last year, is determined to challenge Salthouse for the top spot. Transitioning successfully from short-course to middle-distance racing, she has demonstrated her versatility with recent podium finishes, including third at the Garmin Noosa Triathlon.

"Last year's race was a significant milestone," Van Coevorden said. "I've been working on building my endurance without sacrificing speed. The competition is tough, but I'm ready to give it everything."

Radka Kahlefeldt brings a wealth of experience and a string of consistent performances. With a second-place finish at Ironman Australia and third at Ironman 70.3 Sunshine Coast, she is poised to make a strong showing.

"I love racing in Australia," Kahlefeldt shared. "The support here is incredible, and the course suits my strengths. I'm particularly focusing on maintaining a steady pace on the bike to set up a strong run."
